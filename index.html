    <h1>About Huskies</h1> 
        <img src="images/download.jfif" alt="A closeup of a Siberian Husky Face">
    <p>Huskies are a very stubborn yet smart breed. They are amazing friendly pets but have some downsides, in a manner of speaking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They are very active so they require ALOT of exercise.</li>
        <li>Huskies are also very vocal, so prepare to have a song ready for them to sing and howl along to.</li>
        <li>They shed ALOT of hair.</li>    
    </ul>
    <p>So not too bad. If you want to learn more about Huskies <a href="https://www.shca.org">click here</a> </p>
